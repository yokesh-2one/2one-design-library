  `2one` — the CLI surface of the DLS.

  Exists so the skill works in a CLIENT's project, not only in this repo. The
  audit rules and the context reporter are useless to a consumer if they live
  behind `npm run` scripts that only exist here, so they ship in the package and
  run via `npx 2one <command>`.

    npx 2one info  [--json]        what is installed, and what is misconfigured
    npx 2one check <path> [--json] audit code against the 2one design rules
